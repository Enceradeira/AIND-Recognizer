Observations: 

Validate implemenation:
	- What about model distributions?
	- What about model-exceptions????	

- SelectorCV
	- How many folds are optimal?
		-> Training of "JOHN" very slow with a lots of folds 
	- How does it dependen on features?

	- Is it correct to average cross-validation?
 	



Ideas:
	- Compare residuals -> http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf
		Uniform pseudo-residuals
		Normal pseudo-residuals
